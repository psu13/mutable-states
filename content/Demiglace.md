<p>Back in the distant past before Tony Bourdain was a TV personality jetting all
over the world eating the more questionable parts of animals, I heard an NPR
interview with him discussing <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com
/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/">Kitchen Confidential</a></em>, the book
that turned him into a TV personality who gets to jet all over the world and
eat the more questionable parts of animals. He pontificated about kitchen
knives, what pans you need, when to order fish and so on. Then he gave a radio
recipe for something that is easy to do and makes people think you are
brilliant: demi-glace.</p>

<p>Demi-glace is simple. You make beef stock. I don&rsquo;t really know how to make
beef stock. I usually just buy some random pieces of bone at the Whole Foods
or the farmers market. Then you roast them in the oven for a while (maybe an
hour?). Saute the standard stock veggies&hellip; some onions, some carrots, some
celerey, some peppercorns, and a tiny bit of salt. Add the bones and enough
water to cover. Cook this for several hours while you <a href="http://tleaves.com/2005/01/28/lazy-food/">play
Halo</a>.</p>

<p>Now comes the good part. Take the stock you just made and drain it into
another pot. To this pot add some sauteed shallots, a bit of pepper, some red
wine. Tony also suggested thyme and peppercorns. Knock yourself out. Cook that
over a low heat uncovered. Reduce, reduce, reduce. Play more Halo, but keep an
eye on the stove. It just wants to sit there and bubble and get thicker. At
some point, drain out the liquid to remove the shallots and reduce it some
more. You know it&rsquo;s right when it sticks to the spoon like a thin chocolate
sauce or maple syrup.</p>

<p>If you start with a few quarts of beef stock you should end up with 6 to 8
ounces of the final product. Freeze this. You have now banked four or five
opportunities for people to think you are brilliant.</p>

<p>The next time you make a steak, take the demi-glace out of the freezer and
swish it around in a pan with some more shallots, water and red wine. Reduce
it back to a nice thickness and put it on top of the steak. People will wonder
where you trained as a cook.</p>

<p>Now any time you want a nice sauce and you don&rsquo;t have time, just pull out your
dark brown cube of goodness and you&rsquo;ll see how all the time playing Halo pays
off.</p>
