We were driving home tonight, and NPR was interviewing some Robert Frost
scholar about the publication of a book of Frost&rsquo;s cryptic notebooks. It took
the guy five years to put the thing together. I was drifting into a nice NPR
doze while they droned on and on, when suddenly the host went from relating a
story about Frost at the Kennedy innaguaration to talking about a talk that
the book editor had given at the dedication of the Robert Frost library in
&ldquo;Am-Hurst.&rdquo; At this point my ears perked up. The Robert Frost library is in
Amherst, MA, the town in which I grew up. You pronounce the name with a
<em>silent</em> H. Pretend you are saying &ldquo;Amerst&rdquo;. To this day it pains me
physically to hear people say this the wrong way.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve gotten older, a lot of my old peeves have fallen by the wayside.
However, some of the world&rsquo;s indiscretions still slice at my psyche like a
brand new mandoline julienning a piece of zucchini. Just this weekend, there
was a <a href="http://www.nyti
mes.com/2007/01/28/business/yourmoney/28slip.html?ex=1327640400&amp;en=d2d090cf2db
27104&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss-faisal&amp;pagewanted=all">fluff piece about that crazy Hungarian Charles Simonyi</a> and his
silver bullet for solving the software problem. I read much of it without
getting upset at all. There was a lot of complete nonsense about the paradise
of &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; programming. This paradise has been at least 10 years in the
making with no product in sight. This was not the cause of my distress. I
ignored the rhapsodic prose about a system so sophisticated that the non-
technical &ldquo;experts&rdquo; who just want to &ldquo;get something done&rdquo; can interact at a
magic &ldquo;workbench&rdquo; and build what amounts to a perfect specification of exactly
what they want, unless it isn&rsquo;t in which case they can hack up another
iteration of the perfect specification with almost no difficulty at all.</p>

<p>This sort of hype does not bother me anymore. Our modern world is all about
instant gratification. If people want to delude themselves into thinking that
difficult technical problems have magic solutions, then more power to them.
It&rsquo;s common to think of the general-purpose computer as a machine that can be
told to do anything. But the real nature of the machine is that it can be told
to do anything provided that you have sufficient time and money. If you are
lacking in the other resources, you need to compromise on the specification.
Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, but I don&rsquo;t have time to fight that
educational battle anymore.</p>

<p>I also was not bothered by the boilerplate text bemoaning the sad state of the
software industry. If experts are to be believed, there is almost no modern
endeavour more doomed than that of software projects. They ship late. They go
over budget. They fail entirely. They are the epitome of incompetent
management. I&rsquo;ve heard this before. I find that these days I like to emphasize
the positive aspects of the software industry. The modern consumer electronics
industry has software at least partially to thank for its continued riches.
Almost every major appliance or device that you interact with these days is
running some of this software stuff that never works and is never shipped on
time or on budget. Software is what transformed the Internet from a pile of
wires to something that people want to use every night to talk to their
parents on the phone. People don&rsquo;t seem to realize this. That&rsquo;s OK. I
understand.</p>

<p>I also did not let myself be bothered by the fact that the <em>New York Times</em>
spent so much copy profiling the man who inflicted &ldquo;Hungarian Notation&rdquo; on an
unsuspecting software engineering world in the 1980s. It&rsquo;s amazing to me that
they let him near a machine anymore. But that&rsquo;s not the main subject of my
wrath.</p>

<p>No. What set me off was the reason that the <em>Times</em> writer offers for the so-
called software problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reasons aren&rsquo;t hard to divine. Programmers don&rsquo;t know what a computer
user wants because they spend their days interacting with machines. They hunch
over keyboards, pecking out individual lines of code in esoteric programming
languages, like medieval monks laboring over illustrated manuscripts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is certainly a popular depiction of the software engineer. In fact, a
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/technol
ogy/23geeks.html?ei=5090&amp;en=1c8e3a9e7b614e6a&amp;ex=1282449600&amp;partner=rssuserland
&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">different piece in this same paper</a> about six months ago had this classic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jamika Burge is heading back to Virginia Tech this fall to pursue a Ph.D. in
computer science, but her research is spiced with anthropology, sociology,
psychology, psycholinguistics - as well as observing cranky couples trade
barbs in computer instant messages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so not programming,&rdquo; Ms. Burge said. &ldquo;If I had to sit down and code
all day, I never would have continued. This is not traditional computer
science.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My pet peeve is this notion of &ldquo;just programming&rdquo;, or &ldquo;just coding&rdquo;. It is
hateful and insulting. It implies that what we software people do is
completely rote and lacking in any creativity whatsoever.</p>

<p>Consider that Computer Science, while still young, has managed to keep some of
the best minds of the last century (Turing, GÃ¶del, von Neumann, Erdos, Newell)
busy with its intricate mysteries. It&rsquo;s an area that is a fascinating
juxtaposition of mathematical theory and engineering practice. It has not only
introduced a pile of new ideas into the Academy, it has at the same time built
a commercial industry that has completely changed how we collect, store,
manipulate and communicate information from the world and to each other. And
with all of this as background, this clueless second year graduate student is
still characterizing &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; computer science as &ldquo;just programming.&rdquo; The
field was never just about programming, even if its deepest problems are
ultimately motivated by the toil of the humble programmer. Anyone with half a
clue should know this.</p>

<p>The quote in the piece on Simonyi is insulting in a more personal way, because
it makes a profoundly incorrect generalization about the very profession in
which I work. This generalization is really the same &ldquo;just coding&rdquo; sentiment
but with bigger words. Because software people spend a lot of time doing
something that is complicated and mysterious, it is apparently popular to
think that this is <em>all</em> they do to the exclusion of everything else. The
picture goes further than that. It&rsquo;s not just that we do nothing but this
weird stuff at the keyboard. No. Programmers, in fact, are not capable of
doing <em>anything else</em>. In other words, besides coding, they are not able to</p>

<p>1. Communicate with other humans in a language that the other person can
understand.</p>

<p>2. Absorb and understand the desires and problems of a non-technical person,
and think creatively about how to solve these problems.</p>

<p>In other words, without Simonyi&rsquo;s magic tool, programmers, being crippled in
the particular way that they are, are completely unable to understand the
needs of their clients and are therefore doomed to failure.</p>

<p>Hogwash.</p>

<p>What everyone involved in the production of this piece of goat excrement in
the shape of a newspaper article fails to grasp is that the paragraph that
they have written down above describes a particular sort of software engineer.
Here&rsquo;s the word I use to describe this sort of software engineer: <strong>bad</strong>.
These people should not be hired. If you have people like this on your staff,
fire them. The reason this quote infuriates me should now be obvious. It
basically says that all software engineers are people who don&rsquo;t know how to do
their job.</p>

<p>We should know better by now. We should realize that the things that I have
listed above are <em>exactly</em> what a good software engineer needs to be able to
do day in and day out in order to be successful in the modern marketplace. You
have to be able to understand the problem you are trying to solve. You have to
be able to communicate that understanding to the rest of the team, many of
whom may not be fellow software people. You have to keep communicating this
understanding until the others understand it as well.</p>

<p>A software project is, at its core, an iterative collaboration that translates
initially vague requirements into the relatively rigid confines of the
computing machine. The job of the software engineer is to facilitate this
translation and at the same time to be able to guess how long it will take to
implement it in code and then spend the long hours needed to debug that code
so that the project can ship something that is as close to what was initially
desired as possible.</p>

<p>Then we have to do it all over again for version 2.</p>

<p>In this environment, it&rsquo;s obvious along with everything else they have to know
how to do, two skills are <em>critical</em> to the success of a software engineer:</p>

<p>1. Plays well with others.</p>

<p>2. Communicates effectively.</p>

<p>These are exactly the two skills that the <em>New York Times</em> thinks we poor
progammers don&rsquo;t have. This is why they have tickled my pet peeve. This is
why, for tonight at least, I hate them.</p>

<p><strong>Afterword</strong></p>

<p>Later in the same issue of the paper, there is a great piece about
&ldquo;nutritionism&rdquo; and how it has ruined food. So I guess I will forgive them.
Eventually.</p>
