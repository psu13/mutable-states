Title: Auto is a Four Letter Word

<p>A recent article in <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typ
epad.com/the_online_photographer/blog_index.html">The Online Photographer</a> got me thinking about the
role of automation in those machines that take pictures for us. It got me
thinking about this even though the piece was supposed to be about [what
lenses you should own and carry]() because sometimes Mike rambles. Anyway,
here is what I thought: certain people hate automatic cameras because they can
be harder to control. But we should ignore those people.</p>

<p>Until around thirty years ago, cameras were primarily mechanical devices. A
few had electronic light meters in them, but the user was still expected to
set everything by hand. First, you would do it peer into the viewfinder of the
camera and turn one knob until your intended subject appeared to be sharp.
Then you would stare at the light meter and set the aperture and shutter speed
accordingly. Then you would take the picture, confident that it would be
perfect because you had spent so much time in thoughtful deliberation over all
of these critical settings.</p>

<p>This usage pattern means different things to different people. For the non-
enthusiast who just wants a picture, it is complicated tedium. For the
professional photographer or photographic artist for whom the image is most
important, it is a small bit of technique that is easily mastered and then
forgotten about. Finally, for the enthusiastic amateur, it is a secret to be
mastered and then cherished, since the actual photograph that he is taking
probably isn&rsquo;t all that interesting.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the advent of the automatic camera had a distinct effect on
each of these classes of users. For the non-enthusiast, the more that can be
automated the better. Automatic exposure, and later, autofocus is a great boon
to these people who can now take pictures of higher and higher technical
quality while never needing to think about it. Perfect.</p>

<p>Professional photographers also tend to be happy about these features. After
all, on the high end cameras the most sophisticated automatic systems are
mostly built for them. However, automatic cameras introduce layers of
complexity that must first be mastered before a good photographer can take
full advantage of them. The late Galen Rowell wrote about this 20 years ago
when he compared using an automatic camera to flying a plane on instruments.
Rather than interacting with the scene and the settings on the camera
directly, you have to observe the scene and then also observe what the
automatic system has done for you before you have confidence that the settings
are right. Furthermore, when the automatic systems break down, you have to
reverse engineer their logic to work out how to make it right. Thus, there is
constant fiddling with exposure compensation or autofocus tracking or which
focus sensor to use in the viewfinder just to trick the computer into making
the settings that you would have dialed in by hand on a simple camera.</p>

<p>So here is the rub: with a manual camera you feel more secure about focus and
exposure because you are setting them <em>directly on the machine</em>. With an
automatic camera, the interaction is more indirect. You program the camera so
that it will automatically do the right thing. This is inevitably difficult at
first, but like everything with computers, once the basic abstractions are
mastered they can provide a remarkable amount of leverage. Modern autofocus
systems are so good that users <em>expect</em> to be able to set them up to
accurately track fast and complicated action while still getting every shot
sharp. You might have to dig through a dozen different menu settings to get
things tuned the way you like, but a modern camera can do it.</p>

<p>In the modern automated world then, it is the poor amateur enthusiast who is
left out in the cold. The more indirect way of working with the camera is the
least satisfying for this user, because that tactile and emotional connection
with the machine was at least half the reason he was using the camera in the
first place. These people will complain that they don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;giving up
control&rdquo; to the robot brain of the automatic system, or that modern cameras
have been &ldquo;dumbed down&rdquo; to cater to the uneducated masses. Analogies to
automatic transmissions in cars will be made. This is because inevitably the
camera enthusiast is inevitably also a car enthusiast, and driving is another
hobby where the size of your private parts is reflected by your ability to
quickly perform a mostly meaningless feat of marginal manual dexterity (i.e.
shift gears).</p>

<p>Luckily, we can ignore the whining and moaning from this particular audience.
The truth is that while they are unquestionably more complicated, modern
automatic cameras can be mastered and controlled just as effectively as their
older manual counterparts. And, while it is true that the someone really needs
to take Canon and Nikon out in the back and beat them with a user interface
design stick, I&rsquo;d still much rather be using a modern camera for fast work
under marginal conditions. When push comes to shove, the modern camera can
hold focus wide open with a <sup>50</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub>.4 lens at ISO 3200 better than I can. And
then it can dial the ISO back to 200 when I go back outside in the sunlight
without me babysitting it. That&rsquo;s just great.</p>

<p>Sometimes the tactile wonder of a mechanical camera still calls out to me once
in a while, but it&rsquo;s mostly <a href="http://tleaves.com/2005/08/10
/false-nostalgia/">false nostalgia</a>. I think the reality is that modern cameras really are
better and any reasonably competent photographer should be able to learn how
to master one. Of course, if you can&rsquo;t you can always buy a point and shoot,
like a Leica M9.</p>
