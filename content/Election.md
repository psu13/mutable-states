So we've made it to the last day of another two year clusterfuck of an election cycle. I am in general not one to talk about, think about, or really have much interest in politics at all. But my friend Pete makes a good point in saying that when you can see the ugly face of facism rising up you should at least make sure that you did what you could to be counted.

So I think you should vote for Hillary Clinton tomorrow. And you should read <a href="http://tleaves.com/post/2016endorsement/">Pete's endorsement too</a>. But you don't have to listen to me. But you should vote either way.
