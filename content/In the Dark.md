Title: In the Dark

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I went to see a movie. In fact, I think the last one I
saw this year was <em>The Dark Knight</em>, a summer blockbuster to end all summer
blockbusters. This was a popcorn movie with a difference. It was alleged to
have a gritty and realistic style and was also taken seriously in the critical
community as a movie with &ldquo;mature&rdquo; themes. After two and a half hours and
change, all I remember thinking was that the film was too long and badly
edited.</p>

<p>I was reminded of this on our annual Christmas drive to the &lsquo;rents as I
listened to the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98634268">Fresh
Air</a> film
critic muttering about his ten favorite movies of the year. It came out that
he also did not enjoy the Batman movie and his comments reminded me of the
many aspects of the film which I found annoying. I think the second biggest
failing of the film is that Christopher Nolan does not know how to shoot
action. In his first Batman movie he used the standard American crappy action
director gambit of trying to fool you into thinking that something interesting
was happening by shaking the camera a lot in random directions. This doesn&rsquo;t
make for good action, this just makes you ill.</p>

<p>I think all American directors of action movies should be forced to sit down
and watch <em>The Legend of Drunken Master</em> over and over again until they learn
how to choreograph a fight. In particular, they should pay attention to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duTPLsgHzBs">this
fight</a> which takes place <em>under a
train</em>. Even in the cramped quarters and even though the combatants are using
poles and swords, you can still see every move, every counter and every hit in
an order which makes perfect sense. Watch and learn. I&rsquo;m looking at <em>you</em> Doug
&ldquo;shaky hands&rdquo; Liman, who directed the <em>Bourne</em> movies.</p>

<p>With that mini-rant out of the way, we can move on to the real problem with
the movie. The real problem with the movie is that it plays the &ldquo;dark&rdquo; card
for what amounts to cheap laughs. While doing this, it arguably wastes an
astounding performance by Heath Ledger who almost single handedly makes the
film interesting. Instead, the film just gets stupid and too long.</p>

<p>The problem with the &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; in <em>The Dark Knight</em> is that the film is
nothing but darkness. It starts out dark, the middle is dark, the end is dark
and the boring overlong coda is dark. But here&rsquo;s the thing, if the whole thing
is dark then there isn&rsquo;t any reason to give a shit. For dark to be dramatic it
must threaten something that we care about and in this movie there is nothing
to care about. On the one hand there is a psychopath running loose in the city
causing chaos and havoc. And on the other side, there is a psychopath running
loose in the city causing chaos and havoc. It is to yawn.</p>

<p><em>The Dark Knight</em>, like most adolescent popular entertainment (and, not
coincidentally, most video games), is trying to sell you on the idea that
&ldquo;dark&rdquo; and &ldquo;mature&rdquo; are the same thing. So if you just shoot your movie
without enough light people will decide that you are a deep auteur, with a
head full of interesting philosophy about the evil that lurks within the
world. Unfortunately, constructing a bleak story that actually has emotional
impact is a lot more complicated than this. Dark is not enough. You need the
darkness to threaten something, and too often all we have are layers of
darkness covering a great emptiness.</p>

<p>I found myself thinking about this again while watching a few episodes out of
the first season of the AMC series <em>Mad Men</em>. I have to say that four episodes
in I&rsquo;m again feeling a bit duped by the people <a href="http://tleaves.com/2008/10/22/minimum-standards/">who like TV too
much</a>, but I&rsquo;m going to give
the show a bit more time, because TV shows sometimes take time to develop.
After all, Babylon 5 sucked for at least two and a half whole seasons before
it got decent.</p>

<p><em>Mad Men</em> is another dark contemplation on the nature of man and society, and
for now the reason it annoys me is that it wants me to feel sorry for
characters who, for the most part, are completely unsympathetic. It seems to
me that everyone on the show has created all of the problems they have on
their own, and that the show would be more dramatic, and at least more
interesting, if the pain were being inflicted on <em>nice</em> people instead of
jerks. This is the same problem that we saw in <em>The Dark Knight</em>. There isn&rsquo;t
much to get excited about in a dark world populated by people you didn&rsquo;t like
anyway. You just end up rooting for the movie, or TV show to inflict pain on
them. And when it does anyway, what have you gained?</p>

<p><em>Mad Men</em> was, of course, on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98661164">favorites
list</a> of the
Fresh Air TV critic, who also spent much of his time lamenting the death of
scripted series TV in the current competitive climate. I have some sympathy
for his position, although he sounded a little bit too much like the &ldquo;hard
core&rdquo; gamers complaining about Nintendo. I think he misses the core truth
about TV which is that the only programming that is really worth paying for on
TV is sports. In sports you have the light and the dark playing in perfect
harmony. The Celtics and the Lakers on Christmas day, and the Lakers winning
because the Celtics didn&rsquo;t play good defense, and because they got a lot of
cheap calls down the stretch. That&rsquo;s certainly more interesting drama than any
script I&rsquo;ve listened to this year.</p>
