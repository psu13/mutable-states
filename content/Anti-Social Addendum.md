After I put up the <a href="http://mutable-states.com/anti-social-social-networking.html">original article</a> I got a private piece of feedback from my old partner in crime, <a href="http://tleaves.com">the other Pete</a> that said:

> You need a rule 5: Only use one.

I thought about it for a while, and decided he was right. I have mostly ignored all of the new systems that showed up around the same time as twitter (Instagram, Yelp (sort of), WeeSnapChatTristWhatever). It seems like too much, and the more you use the higher the chance that you will fuck up on one of them and bring the entire world of Internet Rage down on your life. Better to be safe.

If in doubt, you should only use one of these systems. And it should probably not be facebook.
