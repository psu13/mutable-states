I wrote a <a href="http://mutable-states.com/fried-rice.html">page about fried rice</a> a long time ago. Since then I've had an *obvious* realization that I will share with you now.

I can't for the life of me understand why fried rice has not been at the center of a larger food truck/fusion cuisine/multi-cultural/mashup food scene. There are ramen sandwich trucks, bbq trucks, fancy mac and cheese trucks, bad lobster roll trucks (they have to be bad, don't @ me), japanese style hot dog trucks and any number of other cross-cultural experiments in street food remixes and yet the humble plate of fried rice is still relegated to its American Chinese Takeout ghetto. I do not understand why. The menu writes itself:

* BLT Fried Rice: thick bacon bits, rice, stir fried iceberg, cherry tomatoes, crispy bread crumbs on top, kew-pee and plain mayo drizzle.

* Hot Dog Fried Rice: a Chinese American classic. Just make fried rice with hots dogs in it.

* Chili Dog Fried Rice: just what it says. Hot dog fried rice with chili on top. Maybe top it with fritos.

* Currywurst Fried Rice: same idea. But with currywurst.

* Kielbasa Fried Rice: Polish sausage and sauerkraut.

* Spicy Chicken Fried Rice: fried rice with Nashville Hot Chicken

* Kim Chi and pressed Tofu Fried Rice: because vegetarians should not be bored.

* Double Egg Fried Rice: any of the above, finished by mixing egg white into the rice for that shiny richness, and then topped with a slow cooked soft egg for that extra egginess.

* Smoked Short Rib Fried Rice, Pulled Pork Fried Rice, Burnt Ends Fried Rice.

* "Roman" Fried Rice with potatoes, thyme, a ton of black pepper, and Romano cheese.

* Oh. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG5x5IX9ppM">That crazy Japanese omurice</a>, which is fried rice topped with an omelet. You can spin 50,000 more things off of this idea.
	
The list is infinite. I can do breakfast fried rice, lunch fried rice, fried rice for a fancy dinner, fried rice to replace poutine after a night of binge drinking. 

And, if you want something wetter, I can do all that the same shit with congee.

Why hasn't this been done?
