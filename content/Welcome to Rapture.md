<p>I was skeptical about <em>Bioshock</em>. I remember watching some demo reel that
Irrational had put out on the game. While the demo footage panned over a
claustrophobic and chronically damp interior setting, the voice of Ken Levine
spoke over the film, declaring that in this game they wanted to redefine the
shooter, and provide the player with a combination of visceral action <em>and</em>
and a deep web of possible tactics. This kind of talk always makes me
skeptical.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/bioshock">critical
reaction</a> to
<em>Bioshock</em> would also make you skeptical. For the most part the game has been
hailed as an instant classic, a brilliant tour de force, a fantastic
combination of killer gameplay and compelling narrative. Of course, there are
the inevitable nay-sayers who think the game is a crippled version of <em>System
Shock 2</em>, dumbed down for the masses. I don&rsquo;t think either of these extremes
is true. But I do think <em>Bioshock</em> is excellent. While the game is not without
flaws, none of them diminish my admiration of game&rsquo;s polish and craftsmanship.</p>

<p>I have already <a href="http://tleaves.com/2007/08/22/bioshock-
day-1/">praised the pacing</a> of the beginning of the game. This praise holds up for most of the
rest of the game, with a couple of notable exceptions that I will complain
about later. The presentation of the narrative was also interesting. I like
how the short audio diaries were juxtaposed against the plot arc of the
overall game. The diaries and the radio communication do a better job of
fleshing out the various characters and their back-stories. They do this while
cleverly avoiding the problem of doing believable character animation for
extended periods of time, and so you don&rsquo;t have the problem that you had in
<em>Oblivion</em>, where you had to constantly talk to <a href="http://kvdpsu.org/head.jpg">deformed humanoid
robots</a> to find out how to find the next plot
point. In fact, my main complaint about the presentation of the game is that
the character models and animation were particularly weak. In addition, the
animation, spoken audio, and subtitles were constantly out of sync.</p>

<p>I have no complaints about the rest of the presentation though. Rapture is as
atmospheric a game setting as I have ever witnessed. It is dark, cramped,
creepy, claustrophobic and surreal. Vending machines with clown heads play
circus music or scream in Spanish as they sell you ammunition. Huge neon signs
illuminate the decrepit rotting shell of the city while water streams in from
almost everywhere. The areas are great to just stare at, which is a bonus
because the game rewards thorough exploration in various ways:</p>

<p>1. You have to do a lot of digging to find enough ammo if you tend to just
blast away.</p>

<p>2. You can reprogram the various security devices in the city (cameras,
turrets, and the flying bots) to fight for you rather than against you.</p>

<p>3. There are usually inanimate objects lying around that you can use
effectively in a fire-fight (water, oil, drums of various kinds).</p>

<p>The integration of the environment into the combat is where I find my true joy
in <em>Bioshock</em>. The game pays off handsomely when you can scope out the next
area, carefully set a series of traps for the enemies you know are just around
the corner and then sit back and relax while the traps trigger and the city
does your killing for you. Although much of the pre-release rhetoric harped on
the goal of creating a &ldquo;kick-ass shooter&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t think <em>Bioshock</em> plays that
well if you limit yourself to straightforward combat. The game rewards you for
taking a more tactical approach to the combat and combining the tools that it
gives you in creative ways. This is normally not my thing. I like to figure
out how to blast through a game with one or two different weapons. But
<em>Bioshock</em> is different. Where in other games stealth and environmental traps
are just cheap prefunctory gimmicks, in <em>Bioshock</em> they are actually
effective. Where other games only give you a few weapons that are fun,
<em>Bioshock</em> gives few dozen abilities and weapons to mix and match. By the
later parts of the game, I found that I had actually used three or four
different styles of combat to get through, which is rare for me. The strongest
compliment that I can give the game is that it made me play outside of my
normal style.</p>

<p>I will mostly repeat what <a href="http://tleaves.com/2007/08/29/bioshock-for-the-chronic-
underachiever/">peterb said about the
narrative</a>. While the plot arc itself is pretty standard stuff, it is for
the most part superbly executed. Where the game suffers is in dealing with the
standard problem of providing 15 to 20 hours of gameplay in a narrative that
can&rsquo;t support it. The result is that while the <em>story</em> tells you that you must
hurry with all your might to the next plot point, the <em>game</em> shuffles you back
and forth across the map in a series of seemingly endless collection quests.
The fact that the areas are hard to navigate and the map UI is hard to read
just means you also spend a lot of time lost. Finally, as you stumble around
trying to find your way, what I will call the &ldquo;ambient&rdquo; combat constantly gets
in your way. It seems like every time you come back to an area there is a new
enemy waiting for you. This just slows you down even more. This can lead to a
frustrating sense of fatigue. I found myself rushing through levels and
missing important items because I became impatient for the plot to move
forward.</p>

<p>Happily, a couple of well-produced Big Events serve to pick up your enthusiasm
just when you are ready to give up for good. That, and the fact that you can
become ludicrously powerful make up for the fact that the the later areas are
just not as interesting. In the end, the tedium of collecting N copies of item
M wears off quickly, and you are left to ponder the implications of what you
have just played through. The fact that the game makes you think about it at
all after finishing the final boss is something of an achievement, I think.</p>

<p>Some people have complained that the final boss is prefunctory and boring. I
think easy final bosses are a <em>fine thing</em> and should be encouraged. Others
have complained about the vita-chambers, claiming that they &ldquo;break&rdquo; the game
by removing any penalties for player death. This is especially offensive to
the &ldquo;I play games for the challenge&rdquo; crowd. To this I say that two of the best
games ever, <em>Planescape</em> and <em>Lego Star Wars</em> also work this way, and I don&rsquo;t
see what the problem is. I thought that the vita-chambers were a great
mulligan. They let me make small screwups without requiring me to go back and
replay a whole area. Yes, you can abuse them. But it&rsquo;s just as easy to <em>not</em>
abuse them, so what&rsquo;s the problem?</p>

<p>Finally, as it turned out, playing on Medium was not too hard. It just took a
while to figure out what the game wanted me to be doing, and adapt my style. I
even replayed some of the early areas on Hard, and it&rsquo;s not that bad.</p>

<p><em>Bioshock</em> is as good a game as I have played since the &ldquo;Golden Year&rdquo; of
2004/2005. It gets a huge number of things just right, and does very little
wrong. I even like the achievements in this game, and that never happens. I
have to go check out that crazy &ldquo;high school kids blow their heads off with
guns to summon spirits&rdquo; RPG now, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll make another run
through Rapture fairly soon. If nothing else, I have to get that last stupid
achievement before Pete does.</p>
