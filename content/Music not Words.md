Last year I went to a PSO concert that really irked me. I was irked because they wasted twenty minutes of my time in the first half of the concert explaining various aspects of the piece they were going to play after the intermission to the audience. I found this to be boring, pointless, badly produced, and tasteless. I've been trying to figure out how to write down exactly why this was so dumb, and then I realized I already had.

So read it here, it pretty much says everything I might say now, and I wrote it ten years ago: <a href="http://mutable-states.com/classical-music-is-dead-or-at-least-terminal.html">http://mutable-states.com/classical-music-is-dead-or-at-least-terminal.html</a>.
