It's been a long time since <a href="http://www.tleaves.com/weblog/archives/000290.html">the last time this happened</a>. I am usually fairly level headed about the Pats. I grew up with the bad teams and feel like I have the right to enjoy and appreciate the good teams. The team's history since 2007 would make anyone a bit ambivalent about them, but the nature of sports is that you cannot rationally control who you root for, especially if you bonded with the team as a child. After a couple of painful losses in the big game, I'm happy they finally pulled one out. It was a dramatic way to win, and we will no doubt work to add a lot of narrative to the drama that was really more just a matter of luck. Anyway, with all of the other nonsense that's been going on these last two weeks, I also feel the need to drop my usually level-headed behavior and for the record say: Bite me, haters. So there.
