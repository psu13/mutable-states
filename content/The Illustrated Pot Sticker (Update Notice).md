This is just a note to indicate that I updated <a href="http://mutable-states.com/the-illustrated-pot-sticker.html">my long standing recipe for Chinese Dumplings</a>. There were a few small errors related to how to make and manipulate the dough which I have fixed.

Just so you don't have to scan the page on archive.org to figure out what I did, the updates are as follows:

1. I noted that the ratio or flour to water, *by weight*, tends to be close to 2 parts flour to 1 part water (the actual ratio, as measured in a series of experiments, was about 1.96/1, but these things vary a lot on a case by case basis).

2. I added a note that making more dough balls than you need, to hedge the variance, is a good idea.

3. I fixed the instructions that say to make a dough rope about "1/4 inch" in diameter to be more accurate. The actual size is more like 3/4ths to 1 inch across.

In addition, since I wrote that page we've been experimenting a bit with egg and Chinese chive dumplings for the vegetarians. I don't have any strong conclusions yet, but it looks like a plausible thing.

That's all.
