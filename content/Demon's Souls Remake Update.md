Title: Demon's Souls Remake: A Small Update

A couple of extra thoughts on the new *Demon's Sous* that I left out of the previous post.

First, I forgot about a standard FromSoft trope that started in this game:

* Creepy lady who you talk to to level up: check.

Next, I spent the week running the game again on a melee and bow build ... and made sure to set up to get a certain large sword in the end game so I'd have it for NG+. I think my favorite melee weapons are the straight swords and the Uchi, because they are fast. But the end game sword that I worked so hard to get, *Northern Regalia*, is also pretty great if you get it set up right. It works best if your character tendency is Pure White or Pure Black ... mine was neutral so I murdered an NPC in NG+ to get Pure Black. I'm a bad person.

With this preparation I headed into NG+ again (I had done part of it with my magicky character). 

One thing is clear, of all the *Souls* and *Borne* games *Demon's Souls* NG+ is by far the hardest. Lost is the pleasure of melting all the early game bosses with your end game weapons. They hit you like a brick and you barely dent them. 

This is especially true of the one hard boss in the game: Flamelurker. Even my pure black *Northern Regalia* just slowly chipped away at him while his fire punches almost killed me in one hit.

So, I did what any reasonable *Souls* game idiot would do. Bored of burning heals I set up my character to go into "hyper mode" at low HP. Unlike *Dark Souls*, *Demon's Souls* has two items that do this (The Clever Rat Ring and the Morian Blade) and they *stack*. In all a two hand swing of the sword went from doing 375 damage to doing about 1,200 damage. This sort of setup is also great for bow sniping, as illustrated in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYk2EK7Engpm3vvgyWXqJAdjbtkp2woGx">old run through NG+7 at Soul Level 1</a>.

Now I just had to hit Flamelurker six times without getting hit ...

I can quit now. I'll never play any of these games better than that. The one fast punch that I somehow rolled through near the end should have killed me and in any other run would have killed me. I have no idea what happened.

**Update to Update:** I did False Idol (duh) and Maneater (tricky) too.
