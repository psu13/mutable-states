Title: How to Own the Universe and Then Give it Away

<p>Back in the ancient times (you know, 2001), there was an entertainment company
that owned the video game universe. Their lock was so tight that even people
who were not originally impressed with the technical prowess of their hardware
or the aesthetics of their games were still compelled through sheer force of
will to buy the system.</p>

<p>This is a story about how a company can own the universe and give it away. I
speak, of course, of Sony and the Playstation 2.</p>

<p>I should note at the beginning that Sony is a long way from having literally
given up ownership of the video game market. One might argue that the PS2 is
as strong as ever. There are 100,000,000 units out there, and they&rsquo;re not
going into the dustbin anytime soon.</p>

<p>That being said, the ruling position of the Playstation 2 has never really
been in question since the beginning of its lifetime. It started strong, it
crushed everyone, and it continues to crush everyone. Microsoft and Nintendo
made a good show of competing, but there wasn&rsquo;t really any competition there.
Consider that within one year after the American launch of the system, the
following games appeared:</p>

- Final Fantasy X 
- Metal Gear Solid 2 
- Jak and Daxter 
- Grand Theft Auto 3
- Devil May Cry 
-  Silent Hill 2 
- Gran Turismo 3 (hi Pete!)
- Ico

<p>And on and on. These are not all my favorite games. These might not be all
your favorite games. But they are all <em>someone&rsquo;s</em> favorite games. Just about a
year after launch, the machine already had a game lineup that crushed all
comers when it came to sheer breadth, even if the absolute quality of every
title was not world beating.</p>

<p>The PS2 was arguably a conservative hardware design. The only thing edgy about
it at the time was the inclusion of a DVD drive, but even there, the format
was mature and hardware readily available. Sony could crank them out and sell
to all comers, and there were so many customers that there were still
shortages anyway. The PS2 also incorporated a fairly radical approach to
backward compatibility, which gave you something to do in that first year
before the games came out.</p>

<p>The contrast with the PS3 is startling. From the beginning the PS3 appeared to
be the place where every questionable emerging technology that Sony wanted to
foist on an unsuspecting world had rented an apartment and set up
housekeeping. The front-runners in this race of technical stupidity are the
Cell and the Blu-Ray drive.</p>

<p>The great thing about the Cell is that Sony has to figure out how to make
enough of them <em>and</em> teach people to program them at the same time. This,
along with the other realities of higher resolution game development means
that games come out more slowly after the launch of the machine. Microsoft had
this problem to a certain extent with the 360. There is still a relative
shortage of really good original titles on the 360 more than a year after
launch, and there is certainly nothing to go up against that list above from
the PS2.</p>

<p>The great thing about Blu-Ray is that it drives the price of the machine up
and no one gives a shit about it. As a bonus, since the technology is not yet
mature, Sony can&rsquo;t make enough of them yet. You can see how this is a winning
bet on all fronts. It makes the machine more expensive and it provides no
functionality that anyone really wants. Both of these things make people want
to buy your hardware.</p>

<p>Because of these two technology gambles, the status of the PS3 was pretty
risky to begin with. Even so, a well-managed launch with a few good games and
no major mistakes would have locked Sony&rsquo;s position in the marketplace. This
is not what happened. There were supply problems, a truly anemic lineup of
games at launch, people beating each other up so they can flip the box on
Ebay, embarrassing bugs with the video processing and upscaling, and on and
on. Gamers With Jobs has a <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/28304">long running
thread</a> with devastatingly
comprehensive coverage of the &ldquo;haterade&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In its latest gaffe, Sony has announced that it will be <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12909">crippling the
previously much vaunted hardware backward
compatibility</a> in
order to &ldquo;save on manufacturing costs.&rdquo; Given that the only thing you might
want to do with a PS3 right now is play Final Fantasy XII this seems like a
strange decision. Backward compatibility has traditionally been one of Sony&rsquo;s
strongest selling points. Why take an already marginal machine and cripple it
even more?</p>

<p>Watching all of this fills you with a sense of awe. Sony&rsquo;s previous launches,
through the glasses of hindsight and nostalgia were controlled and precise,
with very few mistakes. They lined up the hardware, the games, and the
developers into neat rows and then just marched over Nintendo and Sega on
their way to world domination. It makes you wonder how they could get it so
wrong this time around.</p>

<p>I think this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/Second-system_effect">second system effect</a> writ large, even though this is the third time around
for the Playstation. The first two Playstations were, to some extent, built by
a small subgroup of the company working under constrained conditions. The PS3
was essentially built by all of Sony to be the foundation of future revenue
and earnings in several different parts of the company. When you look at the
hardware, you can almost see the drool from the engineers who got to
participate in this groundbreaking from-the-ground-up redesign of the gaming
console. They were told that they would conquer the world and with it be the
salvation of the company, and they were given free reign and infinite
resources with which to do this. The predictable result is an expensive
elephant of a machine with features no one wants and technologies that no one
cares about. Rather than studying what they did well in the last two rounds of
the console &ldquo;wars&rdquo;, Sony seems to have assumed that they are geniuses, and
proceeded from that position of hubris to screw the pooch.</p>

<p>Of course, they haven&rsquo;t lost yet. They probably won&rsquo;t even lose in this
generation. We&rsquo;ll know how bad things are next Christmas. If the exclusives
and third party developers are on board and shipping, the PS3 will be just
fine. But I think that chances are good that Sony has lost some of that
critical support. The launch screwups, the risky hardware, and the relatively
low sales will have people writing games for the PS2, the Wii, or god forbid,
the Xbox 360. In any case, it should be an interesting year for those of us
who are dorky enough to think this stuff is interesting. Hey, it beats
watching politics.</p>
