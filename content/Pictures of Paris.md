Title: Pictures of Paris

<p>I was standing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Photo_cartierbresson_europe.jpg">behind the Gare St.
Lazare</a>
last week looking around at the morning light in Paris. We were taking the
train to Vernon to go to Giverny, where Monet had his house and famous
gardens. There was a lot of construction around the train station, but I
didn&rsquo;t see anyone jumping over puddles. Even if I had, I probably would not
have grabbed a picture of it.</p>

<p>I have long thought that the famous Cartier-Bresson photograph of the man
jumping into a puddle behind the train station has caused more people more
confusion over the years than any single image. There is a romantic notion
that Cartier-Bresson stood there, perhaps for hours, waiting for exactly the
right instant to stick his camera out and hit the button. But without knowing
the whole story, I bet he was just walking by and saw something interesting.
Maybe a glint of light, or a reflection in the water. Then he stuck his camera
out and took a few frames. Then the man jumped at the right time, and history
was made. It&rsquo;s true that he captured the &ldquo;decisive moment&rdquo;, but I think it&rsquo;s
equally true that the decisive moment found him just as he was hitting the
button anyway. This sort of thing tends to happen when you are at ease and in
sync with your subject matter.</p>

<p>I thought about this over my coffee because here, in Paris, on my tenth trip
to the city over the last twenty years, I had not been feeling
photographically in sync. This was unusual for me in this location, where I
have probably taken more pictures than anywhere else. Usually I walk around
the city for a day or two and all the familiar patterns of light and street
and architecture fall into place and there are pictures everywhere. Maybe we
weren&rsquo;t walking around enough. Maybe it was because we were staying in a
different part of the city this trip. Maybe it was because we went in the
summer instead of the spring. Who can say. I just wasn&rsquo;t feeling it. I looked
around and all I saw were things I had seen before. I wasn&rsquo;t shooting
anything, and because I wasn&rsquo;t shooting anything, I was not &ldquo;exercising&rdquo; the
shooting parts of my brain.</p>

<p>I did fool around with some lame ideas at the Musee D&rsquo;Orsay, trying to create
a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3765475640/">visual play on
words</a> while looking
some of the favorite Monets. But, this wasn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>But then we went to
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3751960515/">Giverny</a> and I perked
up. Because really, when you are looking at this, how can you not.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, because the weather was overcast with occasional rain, it was
<em>perfect</em> for taking pictures in a garden. The overcast sky brings with it low
contrast light that does not destroy the subtle details in the flowers. Also,
for some reason wet green is much better than dry green. In any case, I
finally found something to latch on to and start thinking more
photographically. There were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3764724219/">wide
shots</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3765480698/">small
details</a>, and
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3765481498/">interesting textures</a>.
I ran enough frames to drain the pathetic battery in the D200, and even if
most of them were just generic &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; scenes, the exercise at least got me
seeing things again.</p>

<p>Back in Paris, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3752529415/">everything looked
better</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3752529415/" title="psu_20090724-03376 by psu13, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3513/3752529415_1a73e21b

<p>That magic light that dances over all of the grand architecture in the city
was finally registering in my photographic consciousness. People even started
showing up in just the right part of the frame for me while I was looking at
something else.</p>

<p>Over the last two days of the trip, I took more favorite pictures than in the
first six combined. And it&rsquo;s not just because I burned 500 frames at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3758750583/">Tour
de France</a>. In the end,
as always, I was sorry to leave the city again. But at least on the morning
that we left I was treated to a perfect sunrise shining through a perfect blue
sky, and was able to grab <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79904144@N00/3762955415">one last
shot</a>.</p>

<p>To me this was a sure sign that I&rsquo;d be back and looking for more.</p>
