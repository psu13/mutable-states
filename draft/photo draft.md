I find that in many discussion of camera equipment you inevitably get one side saying something like "well, the phone camera will never kill my *real* cameras for reasons x,y,z,w"... usually two ideas are being passed along when people say something like this:

1. The phone can't do something I NEED for my work. This may or may not be true. You'd be surprised what the phone can do.

2. My work is "too good" for the phone to do it justice, for some definition of "good". This can mean many things. I'm sure you can think of some.

I try not to get into this state of mind. I take the pictures I want to take. I am generally happy to let the phone try, and these days for most shots not needing fast focus, motion tracking, or telephoto lenses it usually does a great job.

But, my pictures are also nothing super special IMHO. On average they are probably above average. My only point was to put the emphasis on what I do with my picture files after I've captured them rather than get into some pseudo-technical discussion about the quality ceiling in different camera devices. I think the piece was more misguided about the former than the latter. It only imagines one way of working, which will never be right. Which I guess is what you said too. :)

Obligatory recent iPhone shot ... B&W processing also done in the phone.

Since I am a long time iPhone camera advocate, I guess I'll come to the device's defense, for better or worse.

The iPhone's strengths as a pure camera come from two basic features. The importance of these features in how you work or what you want out of a camera will almost completely determine how you feel about the device.
1. The iPhone is always in your pocket. You never don't have it.
2. The iPhone is a camera with a large in-built "ecosystem", if you will, of image-related software that is always available to you for capture and/or post-processing (HDR, panoramas, black and white processing, and so on. You can take some shots and then at any point you have some downtime you can have your own little Lightroom session if you want). The iPhone is a pretty good camera with a built-in laptop to do processing work on whenever you want. A lot of people like that.
Again, if you have no interest in any of this, then the phone is not that interesting for you.
To the extent that "most" people use small cameras for grab shots of things that are standing still (food, buildings, monuments, etc), the iPhone's cameras, especially in the 4s-6 models, are more than adequate in terms of overall speed and image quality.
Will it follow focus that dog running down the street for the perfect street action shot? No. (But then, neither will most of the other pocket cameras in the world).
Will it be there in your pocket waiting when you come across moments of nice light while you are walking around doing other things? Yes. Can you use it as a substitute for most wide angle pocket digital cameras when you don't want to take your camera bag along? Yes. Can you capture a wide range of different sorts of pictures in a wide variety of lighting conditions? Surely.

So, sunsets, buildings, food and so on. The perfect vacation camera.
Things the phone will not do:
1. Anything requiring fast focus. No moving kids, pets, and all.
2. If you want noise-free pictures in the dark, it won't work out. But it's still about as good as APS cameras were 5-10 years ago.
Still, the iPhone 4s can do this:

And the 5 and 6 are even better. So don't underestimate what you can do.
3. Telephoto, without weird tricks.
Other notes:
1. You can get to the camera without unlocking the phone by swiping up on the camera icon in the lock screen. Takes 2 seconds.
2. If you want to shoot with the phone a lot, don't use a case.
3. Oh yeah, I love panoramas with the phone. I hate taking panos with anything else.
4. It's really easy and nice to shoot square!
So, could the device be better? Yes. Is it a "camera"-y camera? No. But it's good enough at the job of being a small camera that I can't see spending (say) $600 on a fixed 28mm lens "real camera" that I would have to carry in my pocket along with the phone, if I have the phone with me anyway. I'll take another camera along if I want or need fast focus or telephoto, but for those things m4/3 is really the minimum line, and those cameras are not "small" anymore.
So, on balance the best small camera? I say yes. YMMV.
Last shot: it's also good enough for this guy. ðŸ˜ƒ
