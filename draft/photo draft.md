I find that in many discussion of camera equipment you inevitably get one side saying something like "well, the phone camera will never kill my *real* cameras for reasons x,y,z,w"... usually two ideas are being passed along when people say something like this:

1. The phone can't do something I NEED for my work. This may or may not be true. You'd be surprised what the phone can do.

2. My work is "too good" for the phone to do it justice, for some definition of "good". This can mean many things. I'm sure you can think of some.

I try not to get into this state of mind. I take the pictures I want to take. I am generally happy to let the phone try, and these days for most shots not needing fast focus, motion tracking, or telephoto lenses it usually does a great job.

But, my pictures are also nothing super special IMHO. On average they are probably above average. My only point was to put the emphasis on what I do with my picture files after I've captured them rather than get into some pseudo-technical discussion about the quality ceiling in different camera devices. I think the piece was more misguided about the former than the latter. It only imagines one way of working, which will never be right. Which I guess is what you said too. :)

Obligatory recent iPhone shot ... B&W processing also done in the phone.
