In summary, remember the following things about software models to live a happier life:

1. The model defines what the software can do and to a large extent exactly how it does it. It's very hard to work around mismatches between the model and the features that you might like to see.

2. So when you are angry with your software's limitations, consider what model mistakes the developers might have made that keeps them from making it work right. Now think about how complicated those mistakes might be to fix. Yeah, that's why they'll never fix it.

3. Finally, don't be surprised when new things confuse you. That's just how things work. Sorry.
