Had another thought...

I often find that I take crappy (say) vacation pictures (or maybe I mean to say "crappier than usual") if I have not been "practicing" at home for a while with the equipment and more importantly practicing with my eye/brain system. I find that this practice is very important even if i don't get any "real" pictures out of it. 

So that's another way the aphorism expresses an aspect of truth, while not really being true. Having a camera *can* make you practice your camera/seeing skills. No guarantees of course.

I think this applies even to people who only take pictures in a studio ... having your photo brain on makes you more receptive to the interesting interplay of form and light. I'd claim that it can be helpful to practice seeing these things even if working out in the landscape or the city street isn't your normal mode. 

As an combination amateur dilettante writer/blogger/photographer, I also find that practicing writing, even if you don't particularly have anything to say, makes your writing better when you do have something to say, for similar reasons. 

For god's sake just don't show the bad stuff to anyone. "Picture/article a day" sorts of exercises are great for the photographer/writer, but not necessarily the people who are called upon to look at the results every single day.

As with everything, YMMV.
