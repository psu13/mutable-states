As a long time computer dork (been doing it since junior high school in the 70s) what I'll never understand about the reaction of "normals" (if you will) to the technology is the extent to which they are incapable of ignoring it.

This thought usually comes into my brain when I read another breathless piece in some magazine of newspaper about some writer who just finds it impossible to work with the constant distraction of the Internet around. Why, how can you get anything done with all those emails showing up all the time? Well, you can ignore them.

Just because you shoot a picture with an iPhone and spend some idle moments tweaking it with an editor on the iPhone and maybe even show it to a few of your best friends from twitter from the iPhone doesn't mean:

1. You must deal with *every* picture this way

or

2. The existence of the network must compel you to share pictures that you might think are in retrospect marginal without a due course of editing.

It is no harder to wait to show a digital picture that it is to be forced to wait to show a film picture. If we want to be forced to wait, why not have everyone go back to wet plates? Then you have to wait a LONG time. I see no inherent advantage to forced waiting.

Of course, here I am replying to the Internet when I should be doing something else. But oh well.
