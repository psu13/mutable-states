Back in 2005 I wrote a missive about <a href="http://tleaves.com/wp-archive/2005/04/25/the-breakfast-problem/index.html">how there are no good breakfast places in Pittsburgh</a>. Ten years later the situation is pretty much the same. But I've gotten a lot better at making breakfast for myself. So really it's even worse by comparison.

Let us review.

It doesnâ€™t take much to make a good breakfast. All you really need are four things:

1. Good eggs.

2. Good potatoes or pancakes or some similar anti-Atkins food material.

3. Good meat.

4. Good strong black coffee.

The fact that these four things are rare in a place that serves breakfast is shocking, since none of these items is particularly difficult to prepare well.
