**Long Digression**

One of the reasons I don't write a lot about live music is that I can't remember what shows I've been to see and specifically what was played in the shows that I've forgotten about. I can't remember these things because I don't write them down. I don't write them down because everything I used to write down is now stored in a giant shared information network that can store everything for me.

Except information about music shows (and, to be fair, movies, theater, club performances, basically anything that's "live" in a room).

For some reason every single music related web site (and this includes the pop ones, they are no better) uses the same god forsaken off the shelf """calendar""" view that is horrible in every way. Here is the sort of thing the PSO uses: <a href=:https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/calendar?order_by=production&genre=&organization_id=&start_date=&end_date=">PSO calendar</a>.

Note that this view has a lot of problems. You can only see five or ten shows per screen. Each little thumbnail does not give you all the information about the show (not even all the dates). If they got rid of the idiotic grid and just showed you a *list* they could put the entire *season* on to slightly more than one screen. <a href="http://kvdpsu.org/PSO.html">Like this</a>. Sadly this will never happen.

Also, for some reason every single music related web site seems to think that no one cares what played with their group or in their venue before today, so all information about all past shows is instantly deleted the second the show is over. This is sad.

But there is a better way.

One of my recent musical discoveries is a great jazz guitarist named <a href="http://www.bb10k.com/MH.disc.html#future">Mary Holvorson</a>. Besides playing really interesting music, and even playing it in Pittsburgh, and even playing it at a *free show* in Pittsburgh, the my favorite thing about Mary Halvorson is the site that she maintains listing every past and future show that she has played. It's right here: <a href="http://www.bb10k.com/MH.disc.html#future">http://www.bb10k.com/MH.disc.html</a>. So now I can instantly tell you that I saw her twice at City Of Asylum, with two different groups, in the summer and fall of 2017, just by searching that page. You can even go search it now and see a writeup of the first show. Which was great. I can also see that she'll be back there this June. So I'll go again.

Anyway, if you run a musical arts organization this is me *begging you* to put your calendar into this sort of format. The calendar view must die.
